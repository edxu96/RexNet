## 1. Cost Allocation

> An allocation rule is a general allocation principle that is used with respect to an entire class of similarly structured allocation problems for which there is no objective way to attribute value (cost) to specific members. [_hougaard2009introduction_]

### Quantity-Based Cost Allocation (QCA)

bargaining power of those involved

why the current allocation rules are popular:

- simple
- cost is insignificant
- traditional
- no technology

cost is given, somehow related to quantity by consumers

### Exchange-Based Cost Allocation (ECA)

why do we need in the future

- energy is ought to be expensive so we need fair allocation
- no one is responsible for satisfying all the demand

but are largely affected by other factors.

market segmentation

not to discriminate and explore their max willingness to pay, but allocate the high cost because of randomness to those who caused them in the first place.

## 2. Technological Barrier

> The ideas presented in this article might benefit service providers who previously lacked the technological capability of offering multiple prices but may soon be able to do so. Rapid advances in information technology allow more sellers to design forward-selling systems because they can better estimate forward demand with accurate buyer data and analysis. Technological advances (e.g., computerized transaction systems and Internet interfaces) may also soon lower administrative costs and make advance selling more profitable. [_shugan2000advance_]

The generation resources or network capacities are shared among consumers. However, that way, there must be someone responsible for meeting the fluctuations of consumers' need. The backup capacities are shared by consumers.
