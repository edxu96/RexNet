# Discussion: Hierarchical system structure

For Rex in developed countries, I think two markets at different levels can do the job. Households participate in a CDA quote-driven market where there are few suppliers on the supply side. Suppliers procure through a higher-level market, which can be any kind of market, most likely PDA. The key point is that the retailing level market must be reservation-based CDA, following two important rules:

- No reservation no electricity. It forces households to reveal their information to suppliers. Those who donâ€™t care about electricity bills can always reserve a lot. They will pay the extra to free them from trading. Those with tight budget can trade more frequently according to their consumption schedules and shift consumption from peak hours according to the non-seasonal renewable generations. (Non-seasonality is crucial, or static tariff can be used. Peak-rally tariff is actually applied in power systems in many years.)
- People can trade anytime and receive immediate transactions, which can only be realized by market orders in CDA. Usually, normal people make real-time cost-benefit analyses. They can submit a long-term orders according to their seasonal activity patterns, but they should be able to make changes when new information comes in.
