# Discussion: difference compared to ordinary limit order markets

You can't hold some assets for a long time. They expire after gate closures.

## Consumption Asset. Mar 25, 2020.

> When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish between investment assets and consumption assets. An investment asset is an asset that is held for investment purposes by significant numbers of investors. Stocks and bonds are clearly investment assets. Gold and silver are also examples of investment assets. Note that investment assets do not have to be held exclusively for investment. (Silver, for example, has a number of industrial uses.) However, they do have to satisfy the requirement that they are held by significant numbers of investors solely for investment. A consumption asset is an asset that is held primarily for consumption and not usually for investment purposes. Examples of consumption assets are commodities such as copper, oil, and pork bellies.

> We can use arbitrage arguments to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables. We cannot do this for consumption assets. [_hull2017foundamentals_]

## Futures Exchange Market. Mar 25, 2020.

> The spot electricity is not a tradeable asset in the classical sense, since it is non-storable. Moreover, it is not easy to give a precise definition to what exactly is the spot in the electricity market (see Geman, 2005, for more on the spot markets of electricity). The basic tradeable assets in the electricity markets can typically be described as forward and futures contracts with delivery of electricity over a time period. [_benth2008stochastic_]
