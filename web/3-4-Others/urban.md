## Ultimate Goal

There is no difference between local residence and tourist.

## How to Ensure Low-Cost

Expenditure from utility, like water, electricity and internet,  is calculated precisely.

## Parking Lot Management

> To alleviate such traffic congestion and improve the convenience for drivers, many smart parking systems aiming to satisfy the involved parties (e.g., parking service providers and drivers) have been deployed. The current smart parking or parking guidance systems only obtain the availability information of parking spaces from deployed sensor networks, and simply publish the parking information to direct drivers. However, since these systems cannot guide the drivers to their desired parking destinations, even sometimes make the situation worse, they are not “smart” enough. For instance, when the number of vacant spaces in an area is limited, more drivers, who obtain the parking information, are heading for these spaces. It will cause severer congestion. It is, therefore, strongly desired to provide an effective strategy to address these concerns. [_wang2011reservation_]

## Traffic

> Reservation/capacity management concepts: at present the authors are only aware of one or two railroads on a world-wide basis that use a train level reser- vation approach to the movement of shipments. Such an approach has the potential to support advanced capacity management concepts that might be able to produce lower cost solutions, improved service reliability, and better overall network management.
