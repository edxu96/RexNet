## 1, Introduction

> The theory that we developed at the beginning of this chapter suggests that if two parties put different values on the same good, a trade should take place. If such transactions are to happen quickly and easily, the market must be liquid. This means that there should always be enough participants willing to buy or sell goods. The mechanism through which the market price is discovered should also be reliable. Good mechanisms for disseminating widely comprehensive and unbiased information about the market conditions are indispensable to this price discovery process. Participants also have more confidence in the fairness of the market if its operation is as transparent as possible. Finally, the costs associated with trading (fees, administrative expenses, and the cost of gathering market information) should represent a small fraction of the value of each transaction. These transaction costs are considerably smaller if the commodity traded is standardized in terms of quantity and quality. A market that satisfies these criteria is said to be efficient.

## 2, Technical and Operational Parts of Energy End-Use Efficiency

> The energy efficiency of equipment, like a car, a fridge or steel plant, depends on: (i) its design and (ii) its operation. As far as energy efficiency depends on the design of equipment it is called the technical energy efficiency; it is determined under uniform operation conditions. Efficiency also depends on the operation: the conditions under which the equipment is used, such as temperature and altitude, and also the behaviour of the user. [_blok2016introduction_]

Energy efficiency from design can only be largely improved by breakthrough processes.

> Completely new technologies can often drastically improve the energy efficiency of end-use. Such new processes, with a step change in energy efficiency are sometimes called ‘breakthrough processes’. These processes may offer substantial improvements in other performance characteristics as well (e.g. lower capital costs, higher product quality). [_blok2016introduction_]

### Improvement of Operational Energy End-Use Efficiency

> Good housekeeping improves energy efficiency through better operation of energy conversion or end-use equipment. An important category is avoiding unnecessary energy use, for example by switching off lights in a room where nobody is present, or turning off a machine that is just running idle. Good house- keeping is mainly a matter of changed behaviour, but can be supported by simple equipment (for example, fuel consumption indicators in cars, or timers that switch off the lighting in complete office floors at night). [_blok2016introduction_]

> Energy management systems are related to the previous category, but the improved operation is automated and hence requires upfront investment. Nowadays, luminaries are available that detect the presence of people. If no one is there, the light is automatically switched off. Building management systems in office buildings and process control systems in manufacturing industry also belong to this category. For large industrial sites, energy management systems2 may provide real-time optimization of all energy conversion and utilization processes on the site. [_blok2016introduction_]

## 3, Dynamic Energy Function

The interaction should be considered as well.

## 4, Average Energy Output Efficiency of Controllable Energy Generation

> More practically, one may consider the efficiency of a piece of equipment. This equipment produces some uniform, measurable output P, and uses an amount of energy E. Then, the energy efficiency $$\eta$$ of the equipment can be defined as: $$ \eta = P / E $$. For many energy conversion processes, like power plants and boilers, the useful output is in the form of energy, and the energy efficiency is the usual measure, becoming a dimensionless quantity, often expressed as a percentage. For instance, we say that a power plant has an energy efficiency of 40 per cent. [_blok2016introduction_]

However, in renewable era, the operation of controllable energy generation should be considered under different market environment.

## 6, Energy Service Company

> In recent decades, energy service companies (ESCOs) have emerged and reached a sizeable turnover in specific countries. In practice, most ESCOs deliver a mix of services, which may include energy audits, supply of equipment, instal- lation of equipment, operation and maintenance, monitoring of energy use and financing. A well-known model sees end-users not paying for the initial installa- tion, but for the energy services provided. So, they pay, for example, a monthly bill to the ESCO, but due to lower energy bills, total monthly costs will in total be lower than without the services of the ESCO. ESCOs often give a guarantee for the savings to be achieved. [_blok2016introduction_]
