> Demand-side participation in the provision of system security does not benefit only the consumers who choose to participate. It also increases the options available to the system operator for maintaining security. This helps reduce the market power of generating units that are flexible or are located at critical lo- cations in the transmission network might be able to exercise in the market for providing security services.

## Market Segmentation

The prosumers with high flexibility can adjust and trade near the gate closure.

## Temporal Price Discrimination

> In some markets, earlier buyers are more price sensitive than buyers who purchase closer to the time of consumption. The separation of purchase and consumption creates the opportunity to price discriminate over time when arri- val is correlated with price sensitivity and arbitrage is costly. [_shugan2000advance_]
