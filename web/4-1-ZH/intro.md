We have been using amount of electricity over a long time as generation or consumption since the beginning. However, this method leaves out lots of the information, like that about how fast do consumers change their consumption rate and how much they consume at a particular time. Fixed min generation rate (MGR) or max consumption rate (MCR) are used in this mechanism. The fixed rate means the rate remains the same for a given time unit. MGR means that the generation must be greater than the traded amount during this time unit, while MCR adds a max constraint for consumption.
