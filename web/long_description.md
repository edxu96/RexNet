Lots of real-world systems, like power grids, district heating networks, canteen chains, can be viewed as __stochastic service networks (SSN)__. SSNs consist of two parts, __two-sided service markets (TSSM)__ and __service delivery networks (SDN)__. TSSMs are different from ordinary markets because of stochasticity from both sides. For example, the power output of renewable energy generation technologies cannot be controlled directly. Usually, the service processes require facility devices, goods and labors, which are seen as SDNs as a whole. __RexNet__ is a framework to model and control stochastic service networks. It is composed of several toolboxes, which are illustrated in figure 1 and summarized in the following sections.
