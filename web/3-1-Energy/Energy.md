description: Reservation-Based Distributed Energy Systems and Markets

## 1, Introduction

Power systems / markets, district heating networks / markets are two of the most typical stochastic service systems. With more and more renewable energy generations integrated, the effect from intermittent natural resources is more and more obvious. Command-and-control and economies of scale cannot counted on to solve the problem anymore. According to Darryl R. Biggar, etc., from a paradigm of one-way managed electricity supply, the electricity industry is transforming to a new service model. In this new paradigm the industry exists to provide a platform for the two-way trade of electricity, with all customers large and small, integrated with and responding to local market conditions. This is an exciting time to be studying the electricity industry. [_biggar2014economics_] Reservation exchange based distributed energy systems can be a solution to this transition.

## 2, Why, What, and How

The objective of the electricity market is to ensure the matching of production and consumption at any time, with any network constraint respected. Economies of scale and scope cannot be counted on in the renewable energy era, while liberalization and decentralization of power production have been seen as the solution. However, the most prominent reform, which relies on the step-bidding double auction and optimization to calculate the region price and dispatch, still has lots of drawbacks, which are briefly summarized below:

- Small-scale prosumers cannot participate directly in the incumbent electricity market families or district heating markets, and demand response programs are too complicated and inefficient.
- Intermittent renewable generation companies need economic incentives from auxiliary market, because the market price and quantity are usually counter-correlated.
- Flexible generations rely on auxiliary market like capacity market to prevent from bankrupt, which makes the market families more and more complicated.

A new framework called RexNet can be used  to model and control energy systems and markets. The most important setting is that prosumers must reserve before the realization of generation or consumption, by trading standard contracts in the exchange market to reserve the right to generate or consume in the corresponding future time unit. The dynamic pricing ensure followers who compensate the stochastic supply or demand always benefit more. The equilibrium result from the short-term operation can further indicate the long-term investment opportunity to raise overall efficiency and lower the average price.

A series of discrete event simulation has been conducted to show the effect of different control schemes. With the self-organizing feature, this mechanism not only can be deployed in modern power systems, but also help establish the electricity infrastructure from the very beginning, which means less-developed area can rely on it to develop their local low-cost low-carbon market and network. Furthermore, the mechanism shows promising application opportunity in other network industries, like district heating and electric vehicle charging network.

In finance, a futures contract (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement to buy or sell something at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future, between parties not known to each other. The asset transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument. The predetermined price the parties agree to buy and sell the asset for is known as the forward price. The specified time in the future — which is when delivery and payment occur — is known as the delivery date.

Why we need futures exchange is due to the fact that the electricity consumption and generation must be balanced all the time. If it's traded on spot market directly, there will be two unfavorable situations. The first one is that the electricity generated is not enough, then the supply must be rationed. The electricity serves as a foundation in modern economy, so the constant access to electricity is essential in many ways. The other situation is that there is surplus supply. Because of high cost in storing electricity, most of the surplus will be wasted, which is actually very normal in many countries. Forward energy market can make sure the gap will be as narrow as possible.

## 3, Features of Small-Scale-Friendly Energy Markets

The commodity energy markets like those for natural gas, coal, hydrogen, are liberalized already. However, the energy markets we focus on are end-user markets like electricity markets and district heating markets.

We presume that the following features are needed in a small-scale-friendly energy market.

- Prosumers have time to react to price signals. The real-time incentives from spot markets are hard to catch, because not only the current signals can hardly reveal any information about future, but also prosumers need time to schedule their other activities. For example, if there is a price spike, active prosumers may choose to avoid it, but they need time to re-schedule their activity.
- It is prosumers who forecast their future state and report to markets by trading instead of command-and-control by markets organizers or aggregators.
- Prosumers can trade whenever they want to, because the arrival times are random.

To design a system fulfilling the above requirements, we bring about a new concept to describe these special kind of systems and markets. Based on the new concept, a series of tools can be used to model and control it.

## 4, Deterministic Price-Sensitive Industry

Usually, The energy use rates of energy-intensive industries are quite fixed, so they are not supposed to be exposed to the end-use energy markets. They can always form the long-term bilateral contact with non-flexible power generations to reduce the risk, which is beyond the discussion in this paper.

## 3, Integration of Sectors

Not all electricity generators have the production of electricity as the sole objective or even a primary objective. Some electricity generators also produce heat for a building or local area. For such generators, the need to provide heating services may partially override considerations in the electricity market. In other cases the production of electricity is ancillary to other objectives, such as the burning of waste products (e.g. as a by-product of sugar production in Australia). In the same way the charging or discharging of an electric vehicle is ancillary to other transportation needs and requirements. [_biggar2014economics_] So the integration of different industrial sections is essential to raise the overall efficiency.
