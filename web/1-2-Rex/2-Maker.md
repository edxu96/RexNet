description: Reservation exchange as an organized market mechanism for the two-sided market.
---

## 1, Introduction

The centralized organizer is called exchanger. It is responsible to formulate the forward prices at the beginning of every time unit and accept all the offer and bid unconditionally. Those features ensure that the participants can save the effort to inquiry or wait to receive the issue, so they can focus on trading according to their own conditions. However, if the exchanger is not good at setting forward prices, it may lose lots of money.

There may be several exchangers in the market. The prosumer can switch its exchanger if it is connected to that pool technically. The exchangers have to compete with each other to stay in business.

There are two possible organized market mechanisms for the reservation exchange, and they are discussed in detail in the following two sections.

## 2, Contract Maker

> A market maker or liquidity provider is a company or an individual that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid-offer spread, or turn. [2]

> The most common type of market maker is a brokerage house that provides purchase and sale solutions for investors in an effort to keep financial markets liquid. [4]

### Contract Maker as the Only Market Maker

Overall, the rights and responsibilities of the exchanger can be summarized as:

* taking all the transactions from the prosumers and updating the forward price.
* update forward prices at the beginning of every current unit
* maintain the network facility in the pool.
* manage its population
* make sure the system operates safely

There may be a commission to compensate the loss to be a maker, but the reservation makers have to be competitive enough to stay in the market.



## 3, Reservation Market in Other Industries

> Reservations also benefit consumers by reducing waiting and guaranteeing service availability. Problems do arise, however, when customers fail to honor their reservations. (These customers are referred to as no-shows.) Usually, customers are not held financially liable for their unkept reservations. This can lead to undesirable behavior, such as when passengers make several flight reservations to cover contingencies. This was a common practice of business passengers who did not know exactly when they would be able to depart; with multiple reservations, they would be assured of a flight out as soon as they were able to leave. All unused reservations result in empty seats, however, unless the airline is notified of the cancellations in advance. To control no-shows among discount flyers, airlines now issue nonrefundable tickets and hotels require cancellation before 6 PM of the day of arrival or a one night stay is charged to their credit card. [3]

### Reservation Exchange Markets for Internet Advertising

> Internet display advertising industry follows two main business models. One model is based on direct deals between publishers and advertisers where they sign legal contracts containing terms of fulfillment for a future inventory. The second model is a spot market based on auctioning page views in real-time on advertising exchange (AdX) platforms such as DoubleClick’s Ad Exchange, RightMedia, or AppNexus. These exchanges play the role of intermediaries who sell items (e.g. page-views) on behalf of a seller (e.g. a publisher) to buyers (e.g., advertisers) on the opposite side of the market. The computational and economics issues arising in this second model have been extensively investigated in recent times. [1]

> In this work, we consider a third emerging model called reservation exchange market. A reservation exchange is a two-sided market between buyer orders for blocks of advertisers’ impressions and seller orders for blocks of publishers’ page views. The goal is to match seller orders to buyer orders while providing the right incentives to both sides. [1]

### Advance Reservation for Grid Computing

> Advance Reservation (AR) is a process of requesting resources for use at a specific time in the future. Common resources whose usage can be reserved or requested are CPUs, memory, disk space and network bandwidth. AR for a grid resource solves the above problem by allowing users to gain concurrent access to adequate resources for applications to be executed. AR also guarantees the availability of resources to users and applications at the required times. [5]
