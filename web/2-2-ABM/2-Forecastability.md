## 1, Realization




## 2. Long-Term and Short-Term Effect

> The responsiveness of retail electricity consumption to wholesale market conditions is different in the short-term and the long-term. In the long-term customers can change or replace large electricity consuming assets, or change production processes to consume less electricity, or switch consumption to off-peak times. Electricity consumers (large and small) tend to be more responsive to average wholesale market conditions in the long run than in the short run. [1]

## 3, Forward Time and Forecast Error

![Figure 1, predictive densities of wind power generation issued on 4th April 2007 at 00:00 UTC for the whole onshore capacity of Western Denmark (for a nominal capacity of 2.515 GW on that day). Point forecasts and the corresponding observations are also shown. The predicted cumulative distribution function for the 36-hour lead time is depicted as an example piece of information that can be extracted from such forecasts. \[2\]](../images/ABM_1.png)

## Forecastability and Controllability

> efficient operation of a power system requires information on the likely supplyâ€“demand and network conditions in the future, both the near future (over the course of a day or so), and over longer terms, such as months or years.

> Flexible plants may not be competitive in the forward market, but their flexibility makes it possible for them to occupy this market niche. However, because the amount of electrical energy that they deliver is often relatively small, they may have to charge a high price per megawatt-hour to collect enough revenue to stay in business.
