## Whose Table Is It, Anyway?

IT is hard to imagine Joseph Bastianich, who owns a dozen restaurants with Mario Batali and controls some of the most coveted tables in the country, being flustered by a reservation for two at Babbo for 6:15 on a Friday night.

But Mr. Bastianich was furious: someone was offering that table at TableXchange, a Web site on which diners can buy and sell reservations, hot commodities in a town where getting a table at the most popular restaurants has become an extreme sport.

The price was $25. The table was gone within an hour.

“We’re selling dinner; we don’t sell the opportunity to have dinner,” Mr. Bastianich said. “It goes against the grain of everything we do.”

Restaurateurs in the city say they are flummoxed and incensed by a growing marketplace for online reservations. It has been about two years since another service, PrimeTime Tables, began selling access to the most sought reservations in New York.

Restaurant owners fumed then, saying PrimeTime Tables threw a wrench into their carefully guarded reservation systems and lent to their culture of hospitality the odor of street corner ticket scalping.

But PrimeTime Tables is essentially a concierge service, confirming and canceling reservations as needed. It started out selling tables for as little as $35, and now charges an annual membership fee of $500 and $45 per reservation.

TableXchange is more irksome, Mr. Bastianich and other restaurateurs said. Its reservations are $15 to $40, and the service is similar to eBay, without the bidding.

Some restaurant owners say the service has caused more no-shows, problems in confirming reservations and mix-ups on times and sizes of parties.

Michael Cawthon, who works for a hedge fund, said he had purchased 10 or so TableXchange reservations and did not confirm any of them. (Restaurants do not necessarily cancel reservations that have not been confirmed.)

Georgette Farkas, a publicist for Daniel Boulud’s restaurants, said that if problems worsened, restaurateurs might not honor reservations they determined were made through the site, though reservations would be evaluated individually. Restaurateurs also said they might consider requiring credit card deposits, but were reluctant to do so. Meanwhile, they are hamstrung.

“You can’t really do anything,” said Richard Coraine, the chief operating officer for Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns restaurants that are popular on TableXchange, like Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern. “You can’t punish the user. All they are doing is using something that’s available to them.”

It is hard to trace any problems to TableXchange. Restaurant owners cannot always identify the users, although some are trying.

When Mr. Bastianich saw the Babbo reservation pop up on TableXchange, he said he would eliminate it from the books. But when he was asked if he would turn away the buyers when they showed up for dinner, he paused, sighed, and decided that would be unfair. He later said that he called the person who originally made the reservation and confirmed it.

The buyer and the seller of a TableXchange reservation are instructed not to change the name on the reservation and the buyer is told not to reveal to anyone at the restaurant how he or she got it. So Mr. Bastianich would have had no way of knowing whether the person who confirmed the reservation had sold it to somebody else.

Steve Harmon, who lives in Manhattan but travels often for a technology company in California, said he used TableXchange several times. He described himself as a food lover but a serial procrastinator. “Friday night comes around quickly,” he said.

He said he had purchased last-minute reservations for places like Lupa for 8 p.m. on a Friday night, tables he would never have tried to get on his own.

“It was such a long shot,” he said. “I didn’t even bother.”

Gabriel Erbst, 25, a former investment banker, helped found TableXchange last summer. He helped a reporter contact Mr. Harmon and Mr. Cawthon as well as Jason Hembrey.

After buying reservations, Mr. Hembrey said he decided to recoup some of the cost by selling a table that, in a rare moment of long-term planning, he had reserved at Buddakan for a Friday night but had to forgo because of work. Within a day he sold it for $25.

Supporters of the reservation brokers say restaurants have created their own monsters. Chefs and maîtres d’hôtel reserve tables for friends and other V.I.P.’s all the time, and a skillfully introduced $50 bill has also been known to do the trick. But restaurateurs say that the fly-by-night reservations cheapen and thwart their efforts to cultivate long-term relationships with customers.

(Open Table, the online reservation booking program, uses a different model: restaurants pay a fee for the program and diners use the service free.)

Mr. Erbst said many people who want to spend money at the best restaurants have grown tired of the city’s cutthroat restaurant scene. He said last-minute reservations were worth at least $40, if not more, and that he was considering raising the $40 cap to $50 or $75.

“Time is finite in New York when people are working all the time,” he said. “All of the sudden they can finally get out of the office. They really want to do it right and they want to spend a lot of money.”

Sellers pay TableXchange a 12 percent fee and set the price, the date, the time and the number in the party. Reservations are available on Fridays and Saturdays. Mr. Erbst said the site had more than 1,000 users and that Babbo, Nobu, Le Bernardin and Jean Georges were popular restaurants on it.

Restaurant owners say TableXchange, which also has sites for the Hamptons and San Francisco, is ripe for abuse. What, they ask, is to stop people from reserving tables just to sell them?

Ms. Farkas said that since TableXchange went into business there have been many more no-shows than usual at Mr. Boulud’s restaurants, apparently from people who could not sell their reservations. She said reservationists were finding themselves calling bogus phone numbers when they tried to confirm.

But Mr. Erbst said it would be hard to attribute a rise in no-shows to TableXchange since it offers only one or two tables per restaurant a night.

Mr. Erbst works with William Geronimo and Dwight Lee, who have business and technology backgrounds. He said they designed safeguards against fraud.

He said sellers were not permitted to offer more than one reservation a night or to have more than four reservations in the system at once. He said there could be no more than three reservations a night for any single restaurant. And the site states that if a seller posts a false reservation or one that is different from what was advertised, the seller’s account will be terminated.

Even with the protections, though, there are hard feelings. “It’s not their place to sell our tables or our reservations,” said Lois Freedman, director of operations for Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s restaurants. “It’s like a scam.”

Mr. Cawthon said restaurateurs should be happy that people are eager to pay for the right to dine with them.

And for diners, he said, reservation sales offer “a very convenient mix of giving access to really good places at convenient times on very short notice.”
