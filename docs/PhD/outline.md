# PhD Proposal: Mechanisms, Simulation and Control of Stochastic Service Systems

## Keywords

reservation-realization-settlement, two-sided market, dynamic equilibrium discovery, agent-based models, stochastic simulation, model predictive control, forward market, discrete event simulation

## Outline

### What

- background
	* in most industries, consumers are isolated from fluctuations
	* perishable
	* food and water waste around the world
- what do we need
  * more penetration of renewable generations
  * modern power grids are too expensive for rural areas
  * small-scale participation is cheaper
  * command-and-control is insufficient
  * small-scale-friendly two-sided market
- what: reservation exchange
  * forward market
  * fragmentation and hierarchy
- why CDA market
  * small-scale prosumers cannot participate directly in PDA (one-sided market)
  * flexibility from demand response programs is not enough
- main difference
  * responsibility
  * cost allocation
  * applicability

### How

- why simulation
  * utility theory is not used
  * analytical solution is hard
  * heterogeneous agents have local information
- objective
  * demonstrate the equilibrium quantity discovery ability facing sudden arrivals of new information
  * explore effect of different factors
  * demonstrate the cost allocation
- how: DES-MAS-CDA with ABM
  * different RNGs, wind power output
  * auxiliary activities, forecast
  * continuous provision plant
  * decision making process, make-take management
  * coordination with clients
- literature
  * supply chain management
  * control
  * operations research
  * simulation
  * energy system
  * finance
  * statistics
  * revenue management
  * market microstructure
  * cost allocation

###

- feasibility: why I am qualified for this project
  * familiar with energy systems and markets
  * simulation
  * applied mathematics
- when
- expected output
  * master thesis
  * other forms of interaction: stochastic MIMO with identification
  * responsive clients
  * different rules and market design
  * real-world application
