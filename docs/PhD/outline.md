# PhD Proposal: Intermediated Forward Exchange to Match Stochastic Prosumptions: Reservation-Based Limit Order Market and its Intermediary-Like Participants

- keep the main text short
- relate the project to what they have done
- reference letter
- can share a detailed discussion with you if interested
- add in-depth discussion about relevant literature

dynamic pricing to avoid adverse selection

## What is Rex and Why do we need it

- background
	* in most industries, consumers are isolated from fluctuations
	* perishable
	* food and water waste around the world
- what do we need
  * more penetration of renewable generations
  * modern power grids are too expensive for rural areas
  * small-scale participation is cheaper
  * command-and-control is insufficient
  * small-scale-friendly two-sided market
- what: reservation exchange
  * forward market
  * fragmentation and hierarchy

- why RexNet
  * small-scale prosumers cannot participate directly in PDA (one-sided market)
  * flexibility from demand response programs is not enough
  * prosumers don't arrive in the market at the same time [foucault2013market] or we can use frequent PDA
  * existence of multiple market and responsibility [_weber2010adequate_] because of no direct participation

- quantity discovery
	* coordinators have diverge information about the mismatch
	* their local information may be correlated to the global information

- main difference
  * responsibility
  * cost allocation
  * applicability

## What is RHPO 

- structure
	* clients
	* coordinators
	* CPPs
	* Rex
	* delivery networks

- interested in both the market and prosumers
	* multi-agent system, heterogeneous agents have local information
	* ABM
	* DES

- how: DES-MAS-CDA with ABM
	* endowment
	* request queue
	* model predictive control

- make-take management
	* conduct order submissions

- simulation programs
	* 

- current and anticipated problems:
	* effect of reservation on responsive clients
	* interaction between outsourcing coordinators and clients
	* nonlinear optimization programs in RHPO
	* unit commitment of controllable generations
	* make-take management
	* centralized market makers can be introduced to provide liquidity, which concerns the responsibility

## How to Prove RexNet Practical and RHPO Representative

- why simulation
  * utility theory is not used
  * analytical solution is hard

- objective, what are the questions to be answered?
  * demonstrate the quantity discovery process with sudden arrivals of new information
  * explore effect of different factors
  * demonstrate the cost allocation

- validate the simulation models based on measured data
	* if available

- compare the situation when there is no market

- simulate the market and analyze the effect of different trategies

## What to Do once with Mature Models

- different Rex for different industries
	* determine resolution parameters
	* existence of dealers
	* introduction of bilateral trade agreements to form P2P markets

- design RHPO
	* impact of different objective functions
	* different kinds of weight matrix
	* energy management system

- long-term investment

- new structure for power systems and supply chains
	* especially for under-development areas

## Why I am Qualified

- feasibility: why I am qualified for this project
  * familiar with energy systems and markets
  * simulation
  * applied mathematics
- when
- expected output
  * master thesis
  * other forms of interaction: stochastic MIMO with identification
  * responsive clients
  * different rules and market design
  * real-world application
