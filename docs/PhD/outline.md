# PhD Proposal: Intermediated Forward Exchange to Match Stochastic Prosumptions: Reservation-Based Limit Order Market and its Intermediary-Like Participants

## Outline

### What is Rex

- background
	* in most industries, consumers are isolated from fluctuations
	* perishable
	* food and water waste around the world
- what do we need
  * more penetration of renewable generations
  * modern power grids are too expensive for rural areas
  * small-scale participation is cheaper
  * command-and-control is insufficient
  * small-scale-friendly two-sided market
- what: reservation exchange
  * forward market
  * fragmentation and hierarchy

- why CDA market
  * small-scale prosumers cannot participate directly in PDA (one-sided market)
  * flexibility from demand response programs is not enough
- main difference
  * responsibility
  * cost allocation
  * applicability

### What is RHPO

- structure
	* clients
	* coordinators
	* CPPs
	* Rex
	* delivery networks

- how: DES-MAS-CDA with ABM
	* endowment

- why simulation
  * utility theory is not used
  * analytical solution is hard
  * heterogeneous agents have local information
- objective
  * demonstrate the equilibrium quantity discovery ability facing sudden arrivals of new information
  * explore effect of different factors
  * demonstrate the cost allocation

### How to Prove RexNet Practical and RHPO Representative

- literature
  * supply chain management
  * control
  * operations research
  * simulation
  * energy system
  * finance
  * statistics
  * revenue management
  * market microstructure
  * cost allocation

### Why I am Qualified

- feasibility: why I am qualified for this project
  * familiar with energy systems and markets
  * simulation
  * applied mathematics
- when
- expected output
  * master thesis
  * other forms of interaction: stochastic MIMO with identification
  * responsive clients
  * different rules and market design
  * real-world application
