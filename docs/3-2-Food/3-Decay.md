## 1, Introduction

> Decay (or exponential decay) means that a fixed fraction of the inventory is lost every planning period (this has also been referred to as age independent perishability). In continuous time, this translates to the size of the inventory decreasing at an exponential rate. Very few real systems are accurately described by exponential decay. For example, suppose the local grocery store discards an average of 10% of its production each day due to spoilage. In actuality though, some days it will not have to discard any product and some days it will have to discard much more than 10%. Assuming a 10% loss each day is a convenient approximation of a more complex process. Exponential decay has been proposed as a model for evaporation of volatile liquids, such as alcohol and gasoline. But how often are these substances stored in open containers, so that they would be subject to evaporation? Radioactive substances (such as radioactive drugs) are one example of true exponential decay. However, inventory management of radioactive substances is a rather specialized narrow problem. While exponential decay has been proposed as an approximation for fixed life perishables, there are better approximations. [1]

## 2, Reservation Exchange for Fresh Products

Why customers reserve is because they believe that the supply side can manage to adjust the supply and the price is competitive. The supplier cannot raise the price on the counter. Besides, the negotiation expense increases the transaction fees. Supply side believe that the customers will follow the price change.
