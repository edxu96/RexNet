> A perishable item is one that has constant utility up until an expiration date (which may be known or uncertain), at which point the utility drops to zero. This includes many types of packaged foods, such as milk, cheese, processed meats, and canned goods. It also includes virtually all pharmaceuticals and photographic film. [1]
