## 1. Prototypical Models of Three Types of Clients

### 1-1. Simulation of Forecast and Realization of Uncontrollable Clients in the Supply Side

CTBA-MMFE

CTBA-MMFE for populations

### 1-2. Controllable Clients in the Supply Side

### 1-3. Simulation of Unaffected Realization of Responsive Clients in the Demand Side

- reservation-realization and realization without the market
	* decision making process

- external factors affect the market through agents
  * typical life schedule, time and date
  * factors affecting the life schedule

- evolution without market
  * the effect of other factors is neutral
  * the overall effect from external factors is 0
  * Markov property
  * subjective probability


## 3. Brokers and Strategies
