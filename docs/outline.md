# Outline for Section 5, Agent-Based Models of Prosumers

- what is ABM

- why ABM
	* it is hard by analytical methods
	* how the initially mismatched supply and demand are balanced through the market, unaffected consumption and uncontrollable generation
	* no need to replicate empirical findings like market micro-structure literature
	* decision making frameworks
	* there is no centralized coordinator, interaction between agents through the market
  * external factors affect agents

## 1. Clients and Brokers

- assumptions about ABM
  * agents interact with each other only through the market.
  * hypothesis of independence
  * two major sources of external factors: intermittency of renewable sources and daily activity cycles
	* no learning ability
	* components

- any prosumer can be represented by a set of agent models
	* have no effect on each other
	* summation

- agents
	* homogeneous structure
	* external inputs
	* non-homogeneous parameters and functions

- correlation in the population

- stochasticity
	* anticipated stochasticity
	* arrival of new information: how the new info will affect realization and the market

- Three types of clients
	* uncontrollable
	* controllable
	* responsive

- Requests and Instruction


## 2. Prototypical Models of Three Types of Clients

### 2-1. Simulation of Forecast and Realization of Uncontrollable Clients in the Supply Side

### 2-2. Controllable Clients in the Supply Side

### 2-3. Simulation of Unaffected Realization of Responsive Clients in the Demand Side

- reservation-realization and realization without the market
	* decision making process

- external factors affect the market through agents
  * typical life schedule, time and date
  * factors affecting the life schedule

- evolution without market
  * the effect of other factors is neutral
  * the overall effect from external factors is 0
  * Markov property
  * subjective probability
