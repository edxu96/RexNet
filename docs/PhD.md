# PhD Proposal: Mechanisms, Simulation and Control of Stochastic Service Systems

## Keywords

reservation-realization-settlement, two-sided market, dynamic equilibrium discovery, agent-based models, stochastic simulation, model predictive control, forward market, discrete event simulation

## Outline

- what: DES-MAS-CDA with ABM
  * reservation exchange
  * continuous provision plant
  * forward market
  * fragmentation and hierarchy
- why CDA market
  * small-scale prosumers cannot participate directly in PDA (one-sided market)
  * flexibility from demand response programs is not enough
  * more penetration of renewable generations
  * modern power grids are too expensive for rural areas
- why simulation
  * analytical solution is hard
  * heterogeneous agents have local information
- objective
  * explore effect of different factors
  * demonstrate the cost allocation
- how
  * different RNGs <wind power output>
  * auxiliary activities <forecast>
  * decision making process <make-take management> <coordination with clients>
- literature
  * supply chain management
  * control
  * operations research
  * simulation
  * energy system
  * finance
  * statistics
  * revenue management
  * market microstructure
  * cost allocation
- feasibility: why I am qualified for this project
  * familiar with energy systems and markets
  * simulation
  * applied mathematics
- when
