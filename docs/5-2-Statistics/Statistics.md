## 2,  Visualization of the Simulation Result

It takes a while to step off transient condition.

## 4,  Multi-Stage Lead-Follow (MSLF) Game

Like flexible generation resources are needed for stochastic consumption in the past, there are more and more application of flexible consumption now to balance the stochastic generation from renewable energy. Renewable energy companies predict their generation and report it to ISO. Demand response is then introduced to eliminate the fluctuation. Just like stochastic generation, stochastic fixed demand can also be predicted and then reported to system operator. The researches about demand side response have already revealed many features. We further introduce the two sides response in this mechanism, which can also be seen as a multi-stage lead-follow mechanism.
