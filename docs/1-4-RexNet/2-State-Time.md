description: The state space and time space in RexNet will be discussed in this chapter. There are many different kinds of stochastic processes and systems in RexNets, which will be summarized in this chapter.

## 1, Classification of Typical Stochastic Processes

Typical temporal stochastic processes can be classified according to their differences in state spaces and time indices, which is illustrated in figure 1.

## 2, Hybrid System

The real-world system represented by `PEEFC` is a hybrid system with continuous variables and discrete events.
