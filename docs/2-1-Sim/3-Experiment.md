## 1,  Simulation Experiment Design

> In experimental-design terminology, the input parameters and structural assumptions composing a model are called factors, and output performance measures are called responses.

There is no right or wrong in market design. Once applied in a suitable way, any mechanism can out-perform the general or routine approach. It's important to find the best way to apply the mechanism first. Test, execute and perfect. No one knows the applicability of some mechanism without actually doing.

For different sets of system configurations, we can try to find the optimal control scheme. Then the best strategy behind the scheme design can be found.

### Determine Limit Kinds of Participants

### Test using Different Kinds of Correlation Structure

### The Effect of Non-Stationary like Seasonality

There is a big difference in consuming and generation profiles between workdays, weekends and holidays.

## 2, The Effect of Market Size

Game theory
